## Get Started in 4 steps!

1. **Install** (it's tiny!):
   ```bash
   npm install @client.ts/core
   ```

2. **Define Your First Resource** (`src/api/users.ts`):
   ```ts
   import { createRoute, createResource } from "@client.ts/core";

   // This is the recommended way for non-arrayed types
   export const { static: createStaticUserRoute, dynamic: createDynamicUserRoute } = 
     createRoute<User>();
   
   export const UsersResource = createResource({
     prefix: "/users",
     routes: {
       getAdmin: createStaticUserRoute("GET /admin"),
       getById: createDynamicUserRoute((id: string) => `GET /${id}`),
       create: createDynamicUserRoute((user: User) => ({
         route: "POST /",
         body: user
       }))
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Assemble Your Client** (`src/api/client.ts`):
   ```ts
   import { createClient } from "@client.ts/core";
   import { UsersResource } from "./users";
   
   export const client = createClient("https://api.yourservice.com", {
     users: UsersResource
   });
   ```

4. **Use Like a Pro**:
   ```ts
   // Get typescript support for your requests easily!
   const { data: user } = await client.users.getAdmin();
   
   // Create user with type-checked payload
   await client.users.create({ name: "Alice", role: "admin" });
   ```

> **⚛️ React Support**
> 
> *client.ts* supports React that makes using the library even easier to use with React
> applications with minimal footprint, no other dependencies other than React, Typescript and
> Client.ts.

## Key Knowledge

### Declarative Route Definitions

Define routes as either static or dynamic:
- **Static Routes**: Use a simple string (e.g., `GET /`) to define a route, these routes have some minor memoization 
when creating the request, so it may be slightly faster, but not by any identifiable measure.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Use functions to generate routes based on parameters, or even return an object with advanced request details.

Example:
```ts
createClient("baseUrl", {
    resource: {
        prefix: "/resource", // Optional
        routes: {
            get: createRoute<Resource[]>().static("GET /"),
            getById: createRoute<Resource>().dynamic((id: number) => `GET /${id}`),
            create: createRoute<Resource>().dynamic((resource: Resource) => ({
                route: "POST /",
                body: resource
            }))
        }
    }
});
```

### Reusable Route Creators
Keep your code DRY by reusing route creators across multiple resources:
```ts
import { createClient, createRoute, createSingleAndArrayedRoute } from "@client.ts/core";

// Convenience methods for handling single or arrayed resources
const { single: resourceRoute, arrayed: resourcesRoute } = createSingleAndArrayedRoute<Resource>();

// Simplified route creation for non-array resources
const { dynamic: createDynamicRoute, static: createStaticRoute } = createRoute<AnotherResource>();

const client = createClient("baseUrl", {
    resource: {
        prefix: "/resource",
        routes: {
            get: resourcesRoute.static("GET /"),
            getFirst: resourceRoute.static("GET /first"),
            getById: resourceRoute.dynamic((id: number) => `GET /${id}`)
        }
    },
    anotherResource: {
        prefix: "/another-resource",
        routes: {
            get: createStaticRoute("GET /"),
            getById: createDynamicRoute((id: number) => `GET /${id}`)
        }
    }
});
```

### Encoder and Decoder
Client.ts, by default, uses `JSON.stringify` as the encoder and `JSON.parse` as the decoder, as most of the web standards uses JSON. Although, there are special cases in 
encoding where we ignore the `encoder`, these cases are when the type of the body is supported by native fetch, which are:
* **String**
* **ReadableStream**
* **FormData**
* **ArrayBuffer**
* **URLSearchParams**

If you want to handle those body beforehand, use **Hooks** to transform the request body to your liking before it gets passed to the connector. You can also specify 
a different encoder at a global, per-resource and per-route level by specifying the `encoder` and `decoder` properties.

### Fetch
Client.ts is built on top of the native fetch API, which is supported by all modern browsers. But, we do not support all options that fetch has, although 
we allow you to pass options that we do not support through the `additionalFetchOptions` property in a per-client, per-resource and per-route level, this means 
that you can add options like `credentials`, `mode`, `cache` for browser, or `idempotent`, `blocking`, `reset` for undici fetch.

We do it this way because we want to keep the library compatible with most environments, as much as possible. Although, there are definitely scenarios where we cannot 
fulfill this compatibility, but we will try our best to make it as compatible as possible.

### Route Paths

We specifically enforce a type of `${method} ${path}` for route paths, this is to make it easier for developers to understand
what the route is doing at a glance, but some people might want to use specific Typescript typing for their route paths, in which case, you can use the
`createRoutePath` utility function to create a route path with a specific type.

```ts
import {createRoutePath, createRoute} from "@client.ts/core";

const sampleRoute = createRoute<Post>().static(createRoutePath("GET", "/posts"));
```

Although we definitely recommend using the `${method} ${path}` format as it's easier to understand at a glance rather than stacking
multiple methods.

## 🔰 Validators: Prevent Invalid Requests

Add validators at any level to ensure your requests match what should be expected. These executes before 
hooks, and is recommended to be used for validating the response before it gets passed to the hooks, and before the 
Promise resolves.

```ts
const requireStatus200 = createValidator("validators.status_code:200", (res, reject) => {
  if (res.statusCode !== 200) {
    return reject("Status code is not 200.");
  }
});
```

## 🔌 Hooks: Supercharge Your Workflows

Add hooks magic at any level:

```ts
// Authorization hook factory.  Adds a Bearer token to the request headers.
const withAuth = (token: string) => createHook({
  beforeRequest: (req) =>
    req.merge({
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    }),
});

// Logging hook. You can use hooks to even transform responses into another liking.
const logRequests = createHook({
  afterRequest: (req, res) => {
     console.info(`Rececived status ${res.statusCode} for request.`, request);
     return res;
  }
})

// Remember to reuse your route creators since it's cleaner this way.
const { static: createStaticSecretDataRoute, dynamic: createDynamicSecretDataRoute } = createRoute<SecretData>();

// Create an API client with authorization hooks applied at different levels.
const client = createClient(BASE_URL, {
  posts: {
    // Resource-level authorization: Applies to all routes within 'posts'.
    hooks: [withAuth("Resource level")],
    routes: {
      get: createDynamicSecretDataRoute(() => {
        return {
          route: "GET /secret",
          // Route-level authorization: Overrides/adds to resource-level auth.
          hooks: [withAuth("Route level")],
        };
      }),
    },
  },
}, {
  // Log all requests received.
  hooks: [logRequests],
});
```

**Hook Superpowers:**
- 🛡️ Add auth headers
- 📊 Logging/monitoring
- ⏱️ Request timing
- 📦 Response normalization

## 🏗️ Project Structure Blueprint

We **strongly recommend** this scalable structure:

```
src/
├─ api/
│  ├─ client.ts          # Main client instance
│  ├─ hooks/             # Reusable middleware
│  │  └─ auth.ts
│  └─ resources/         # API resource definitions
│     ├─ posts.ts
│     ├─ users.ts
│     └─ products.ts
```

**Example Resource File** (`resources/posts.ts`):
```ts
import { createSingleAndArrayedRoute, createResource } from "@client.ts/core";

const { single: postRoute, arrayed: postsRoute } = createSingleAndArrayedRoute<BlogPost>();
const Posts = createResource({
  prefix: "/posts",
  routes: {
    trending: postsRoute.static("GET /trending"),
    draft: postRoute.dynamic((id: string) => ({
      route: `GET /drafts/${id}`,
      headers: { 'X-Draft-Access': 'true' }
    }))
  }
});

export default Posts;
```
